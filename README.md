# self-instruct-gpt4mini

**Objective:**  
A scaled-down reproduction of the *SELF-INSTRUCT* framework (Wang et al., 2023), using OpenAI’s `gpt-4o-mini` via API calls instead of local model fine-tuning.  
This project explores instruction generation, filtering, and evaluation pipelines for aligning LLMs with self-generated data — under a <$100 compute budget.
